# MNIST-Small-Large-dataset-Classifier-Comparison-
Comparing classifiers on the MNIST dataset, using both small and large subsets, evaluates their performance in digit recognition. Deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) tend to excel, especially with larger datasets, outperforming traditional classifiers due to their capacity to capture complex features.
